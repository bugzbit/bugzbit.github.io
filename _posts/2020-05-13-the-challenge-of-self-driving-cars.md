AI is the next big thing and Self driving cars were meant to be its greatest proof of concept . Many top brands after jumping into the Self Driving-tech bandwagon are now slowly pulling.&nbsp; One such fatality was the transport-tech giant Uber.&nbsp; Organizations like Google Waymo, Toyota, and GM were predicting a launch by 2020 in the year 2015. Tesla went ahead to claim a fully functional self driving car by 2018, but none on these players seem to see the light of the day.

Here is a list of challenges self driving cars manufacturers are facing.

**1\. Data**

AI tech, being the forefront of Self driving cars, relies on a lot of data to train itself. Self driving cars would have to go through hours of training videos and data of real world to come up with good driving behavior.

**2\. Uncertainty**

In a real world on road situation, uncertainties related to external conditions like weather, road conditions , traffic conditions, and vehicle condition bring in a lot more parameters than can be actually simulated in a lab. This uncertainty also leads to the next point.

**3\. Insurance and Liabilities**

In case of an accident, who shall be liable? Since most of the driving is done by the software and&nbsp; since the person behind is in a relaxed state to take any impromptu actions to avoid any accident. Will the software manufacturers be liable to pay for insurance or damages.

**4\. Interference**

Self driving cars use technologies like Radar, Lasers and cameras for navigation. Any radar jamming signals or electromagnetic interference is going to kick the software of its feet. Hope that self driving car makers have taken in consideration conflicting signals being emitted from other cars.

Self driving cars will be here but when is a matter of time.
