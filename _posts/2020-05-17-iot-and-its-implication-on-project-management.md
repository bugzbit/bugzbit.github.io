Internet of Things(IoT) is all about anything natural or manmade, which can follow protocols over the internet and enable transfer of data with web enabled smart devices. The applications of IoT are limitless, as requirement for devices which work with minimum or no human intervention increases day by day.One such verticle for implementation is Project Management.

Just like any other field, Project Management has its own sets of challenges. These challenge brings in an opportunity for innovation and expertise to reduce errors and ensure automation. This article is an attempt to dwell and understand more of these Challenges and IOT Solutions

## Improper Goal Setting and poorly defined Objectives

The first phase of setting up. Project managers come across situation where projects get delayed or shelved due to improper goal setting poorly defined objectives. IoT will bring in access to Big Data and improved analysis. This will help project managers in smarter decision making out of qualitative and quantitative data. These data can be seemlessly integrated with existing ERP of an organisation, enabling teams to accurately predict future outcomes.

## Lack of Effective Communication

Communication barriers, can lead any well defined project into a disaster. Teams after teams are changed at the expense of the project and organisation to get their communication right. Connected Devices and constant flow of data can be arranged with IoT. No more manual compilation of status reports, and real time data flow from connected equipments can provide managers enough insight to communicate effectively at the same time to multiple teams.

> According to [*PMI*](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/the-essential-role-of-communications.pdf){: target="_blank"}, for every $1 billion spent on a project, the organization risks $135 million. Furthermore, another research indicates that about 56% of this expense is put at risk due to ineffective communications.

## Risk Management

Prempting Risk and and at the same time coming up with a definitive strategy to mitigate risk is one of the primary roles of the project manager. IoT allows real-time control and monitoring of processes any arising contingencies and at the same time. Taking prompt actions and communication across teams and equipments can reduce impact of any undesirable circumstances.

## Budgeting Accuracy

Underestimating cost is one of the most of the common mistakes made in Project Management. Expenses of multiple teams like HR, consultants, equipment along with other unplanned costs can take the project budget for a toss. IoT helps in monitor and control real-time cost impacts and help make budgeting decisions.

IoT gives enablers like data management and analysis, Monitoring and control, faster reporting allowing faster project life with minimum contingencies.
