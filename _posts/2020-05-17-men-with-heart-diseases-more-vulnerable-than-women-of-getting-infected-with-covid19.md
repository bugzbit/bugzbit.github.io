Research shows that men with heart problems have higher concentration of ACE2 , compared to women, which allows COVID-19 virus to easily infect healthy cells.

ACE2(angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is a type of protein present in the blood plasma. ACE2 is the receptor on the surface of cells. The concentration of ACE2 are higher in the lungs hence a major cause of lung disorders when infected with COVID-19

A Group of 2000+, including men and women, were measured for ACE2 concentrations from 2 groups from 11 European Countries. The reassearch suggest though men and women&nbsp; are susceptible to infections equally , but men are more likely to suffer due to infections

The European Heart Journal also suggested that the heart failure patients who are under treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARB (angiotensin receptor blockers), have lower concentration of&nbsp; ACE2 reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections.

Though there are some limitations to the study as the concentrations of ACE2 measured was on&nbsp; blood plasma and not on ACE2 tissue, not leading to a definitive conclusion whether the concentration will be similar in case of Tissues
