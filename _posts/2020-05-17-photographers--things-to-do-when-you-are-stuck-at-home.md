Most of us are stuck at home with little or no income. Best part of this we can do thing we normally wouldn’t do or don’t have time for. We can’t even go out anymore to take pictures in nature. In these times we are kind of forced to do some work from behind our desk. I’ll be sharing a list of ‘things to do’ for all photographers while you’re stuck at home.

1\. **Process old images**.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are a landscape photographer and have ample of backlog due to&nbsp; excess of traveling or workload, this might be the right time to stick to your computer. Remove all the old hard drives from your closet and start working on&nbsp; them.

**2\. Improve your skills**

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These days getting hold of the right online course for the skill you are lacking may not be difficult at all. YouTube can be a huge source of online tutorials to learn photography and processing skill. If you are a professional, you can use your spare time offering paid tutorials via skype.

**3\. \*\*Organise your Gear \*\***

&nbsp;We have countless gears from doing years and years of photography. Some of it we never use. Think of old lenses, old bodies, tripods, etc. Spend some time to sort everything and see what you can give away or sell.

4\. **Find a inspiration\!**

Websites like [Behance](https://www.behance.net/){: target="_blank"} can be a great resource to checkout work of some awesome photographers.&nbsp; Not just for photography, but also all kinds of digital art like drawing, 3d, etc. Also make sure you&nbsp; follow some top [photographers](https://expertphotography.com/49-famous-photographers-follow-online/){: target="_blank"} online.

**5\. Start working on your website**

Not limiting your self to building a website and uploading you work, Start working on other aspects too&nbsp; like the SEO of Website so that its is more search friendly.

**6\. Start a photoshoot around your house**

Inside a house you can do macro photography and focus stacking, explore indoor light-painting options, shoot multiple exposures with a tripod and practice your mad Photoshop compositing skills (even if you're just putting yourself or your dog into 8 poses on the same sofa), and try those cool slit-scan photography effects you can do when you shoot motion and try processing actions into interesting stills.
