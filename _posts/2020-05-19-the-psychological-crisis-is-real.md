A life obstacle, physical problems, or perception of experience can be one of the many reasons why individuals may experience psychological problems. As the world gets faster pace the occurrence of such psychological crisis increases day by day. 

Events or genetic conditions may affect differently on different persons making a more complex subject of study. There is no one-size-fits-all solution available. With the number of people affected by mental health issues increasing every day, it qualifies as a crisis.

> According to WHO, around 450 million people suffer from mental illness


## The cost to self

People with psychological conditions have been more prone to addiction to hallucinating devices leading to substance abuse. Some disorders have also lead to long term medical conditions due to mental health issues. The world health organization estimates that one person dies of suicide every 40 seconds around the world. It is very difficult for individuals to accept and detect that they are going through any mental health conditions. By the time people realize they have some problems it the illness seems to have already taken a toll on their wellbeing.

## The cost to the family

When it comes to mental health the cost to the family does not limit to financial troubles. Family members of persons with mental health issues, often display symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression. Children are the biggest sufferers when it comes to parents with mental health issues. 

> According to a Swedish study, one-half of family members claimed they had developed psychological or social problems (such as sleeping problems and depression) of their own, to such an extent that they also needed help and support.

## The Cost to the Society

Loss in productivity, and increased cost to the health care systems are the common cost associated with mental health issues. Along with this, patients with extreme mental health disorders seem to have resorted to substance abuse and violence creating stress on the law and order situation.

## The Solution.

Society, family, and the individual should stop looking 'Psychological Health' as a taboo and instead start looking mental health as any other medical condition. Timely intervention, self-help, family support, and community support can stop a psychological crisis before it ends up as an epidemic.
