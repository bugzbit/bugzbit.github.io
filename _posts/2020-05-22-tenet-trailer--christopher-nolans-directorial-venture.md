An intriguing trailer of TENET, Starring Robert Pattinson, John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki, , Michael Caine, Dimple Kapadia, and Kenneth Branagh with an undisclosed plot was released on Fortnite.

Christopher Nolan, one of Hollywood's some sought after director, with accolades winning movies such as The Dark knight Trilogy, Inception, and Dunkirk, has partnered with Warner Bros. Studios to direct TENET. Here is a trailer.

The trailer discloses some ideas related to international espionage and has something to do with the time-reversal/manipulation concept. With John David Washington in the lead role, Rober Pattison too shares plenty of screentime with him. The trailer though doesn't mention a release date whereas the original release date was July 17th 2020 as per some marketing on twitter. Due to the current COVID-19 health crisis it will be a test of how the movie performs on big screens.

&gt; “We’re jumping off from the point of view of an espionage film, but we’re going to a number of different places. We’re crossing a few different genres in a hopefully exciting and fresh way.” -Christopher Nolan to Entertainment Weekly &nbsp;

That being said, since it is a Christopher Nolan movie, audiences are sure to get enthralled.
