## 1\. Contact Tracing

Contact Tracing is the primary reason why South Korea was able to contain cases at peak levels. The country's prior experience with MERS in 2015, gave rise to the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act, which allowed the government to track a cell phone, and financial information to identify and trace movements of infected people.

KETI and ministry of Land, infrastructure, and transport designed the Epidemic Investigation Support System(EISS) in March 2020. The system allowed authorities to track positive cases and their movements. The system tracks along with cell phone and financial information shares urban planning, demographic, and traffic information, though with some teething problems, has successfully enabled the establishment to lower the number of deaths which now stands at 206.

## 2\. Trust in the Government

Though these invasive methods most probably would not see any light of day in western countries, South Koreans have shown reasonable trust in their establishment. 'Lives over privacy' is what many government officials have echoed through their statements. Till the time such an act is saving lives, no seems to be complaining.

## 3\. A Cultural Thing

> “Such information should only be used for crises like infectious diseases,” said Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-Myung. “But thankfully our people understand that it is inevitable in battling the pandemic.”

Learning from their MERS epidemic, not too early, Koreans have a basic understanding of how to react during an epidemic. Koreans have shown immense responsibility to avoid acts that could put others in danger.
