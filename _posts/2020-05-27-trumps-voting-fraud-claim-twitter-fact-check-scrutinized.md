Earlier today, I just noticed Donald Trump's Twitter timeline with the fact check feature introduced by twitter. Here is the actual tweet.

> There is NO WAY (ZERO\!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....
> â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [May 26, 2020](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
{: .twitter-tweet}

This tweet was substantiated by twitter mentioning the following lines

As a neutral spectator, I would be exploring the claim from twitter and also proof check the original tweet's authenticity.

Let us

## Claim 1

***Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud.***

Who are these fact-checkers? Why is there no mention of who the fact check agency is? Is it inhouse twitter employees who assume that their belief is true. As far as it is known, that an assumption can be fact-checked but a prediction can't be fact-checked. Just because a car is locked does it mean it can't be broken into. Donald Trump statement implies he is suspicious of voter fraud and lacks faith in the governor of California

My Verdict: Claim 1 falls flat by poor comprehension.

## Claim 2

***Trump falsely claimed that California will send mail-in ballots to "anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there." In fact, only registered voters will receive ballots.***

Once again twitter mentions that his prediction of how the Governor of California may misuse the Mailbox voting by sending emails to anyone and everyone. Though Twitter here claims only registered users can receive ballots, which seems utopian, because of the next few points.

1. [*NBC Los angeles*](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/politics/more-than-80-ballots-sent-to-san-pedro-apartment/106443/) and [*Independent Sentinal*](https://www.independentsentinel.com/83-ballots-left-atop-a-single-elderly-ladys-mailbox-in-la-but-it-cant-be-voter-fraud/) report of the 83 ballots in a single elderly lady's mailbox proves that the system is not foolproof.
2. Another [*report*](https://nationalfile.com/video-citizen-busts-democrat-mail-in-voting-scandal/) where the democrats have misused the mail-in ballot campaign to create surrogate mail ballots.
3. [*NBC new york*](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mail-in-votes-already-set-aside-due-to-paterson-voter-fraud-claims/2414171/) reports of a similar case of voter fraud claims in Paterson.

My Verdict: Mail-in Voting doesn't seem to be a foolproof idea of voting as claimed by twitter but also the objective of the statement doesn't come in the ambit of a fact check.

## Claim 3

***Five states already vote entirely by mail and all states offer some form of mail-in absentee voting, according to NBC News.*** This statement seems to be out of context for the tweet from Donald Trump. Just because it is happening in other states it doesn't mean there is no chance of fraud. It just seems to be an addon statement. It is not fraud until someone is caught doing it is what twitter seems to imply.

My Verdict: This claim has very little relation to the context of the tweet and doesn't add value to their fact check.

\#\# Conclusions

It seems like Twitter has made a mess of its fact check feature in this specific tweet. There is no historical claim from Donald Trump which has to be fact-checked in the first place. Twitter cannot assure voting fraud will not take place. Agenda or not but that is not how a fact check is done.
