People prefer sugar free/diet drinks so that they can enjoy their favorite drink without consuming a lot of calories. Seems reasonable. Is it? 
An average 12-ounce can of regular sugar-sweetened beverage delivers approximately 150 calories. The same amount of sugar-free drink delivers zero calories. A person who is health-conscious or trying to lose weight, switching to diet beverages seems like a logical decision. However, various studies have shown that consuming sugar-free drinks can cause adverse effects. 

**What are sugar-free drinks: **
It mimics the taste of traditional drink; however, it provides no calories. 
These drinks include artificial sweeteners to develop the taste.

**What are artificial sweeteners? **
Artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes are chemicals added to food and beverages, to make them sweet without adding calories. They are 100 times sweeter than table salt. 
Some common artificial sweeteners approved by the FDA are saccharin, acesulfame, aspartame, neotame, and sucralose. FDA has also approved natural sweetener, stevia.

**Why sugar-free drinks are bad for health?**
The human body is very complex. The way our body and mind react to these artificially sweetened drinks is also very complex. 
Metabolic syndrome: According to a multi-ethnic study published in April 2009, in the “Diabetes Care” journal, daily intake of diet drinks was associated with a 36% increased risk of metabolic syndrome and 67% more risk of type 2 Diabetes mellitus. The irony is these were the disease which was supposed to be benefitted by sugar substitutes.
More sugar craving: People consume sugar-free drinks rather than sugar-sweetened, to decrease calorie intake and lose weight. However, an article published in “Yale journal of biology and medicine” in June 2010 says otherwise. It was observed that natural sweeteners can initiate a reward pathway in the brain, which leads to satiation. While the brain responds differently to artificial sweeteners, leaving you unsatisfied, which in turn can lead to increased appetite, more craving for sugary food. 
Weight gain: Due to increased sugar craving people tend to overeat, which leads to weight gain. That’s not it, there is more to the story – Overcompensation. When you replace sugar-sweetened drinks with a calorie-free drink, you tend to eat more in other parts of your diet. Fooling yourself by thinking, “I had a diet drink, so I can have one more slice of Pizza.” Ultimately consuming more calories and hence weight gain.

Cancer: Some research has noted the link between consuming sugar substitute and cancer risk. However, there is no solid evidence. 
Other associated risks: There are increasing shreds of evidence that suggest that diet drinks correlate with a wide range of medical conditions including heart conditions (such as heart attack and elevated blood pressure), brain conditions (such as dementia), and liver conditions (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Researchers do not understand the exact mechanism behind it; however, some researchers believe that it might damage blood vessels or give rise to chronic inflammation. 
Also, a study conducted in 2017 suggests a correlation between sugar-free drinks and increased risk of stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. 

 
Summary:
Many researchers have found a link between the consumption of sugar-free drinks to a wide range of risks about health. While the exact correlation between diet drinks and medical conditions is unclear and needs more research in the field. It is intelligible to refrain from it.
