California man ballots on behalf of his dead mother in three different elections caught for mail-in ballot fraud.

The l. a. District Attorney's Office announced Tuesday that Caesar Peter Abutin pleaded guilty to committed mail-in voting fraud on three instances from 2012 to 2014, whenever mailing during a ballot registered to his mother, who died in July 2006.

Abutin was charged last month with one felony count of fraud and one count of fraudulent voting. Abutin fraudulently signed the name of his mother when applying for a vote by mail ballot.

Mail-in voting has become a topic of political discourse before the November presidential election, as President Trump regularly speaks out against it – due to its inefficiencies, and its susceptibility to fraudulently voting schemes, just like the case in California.

> “You can’t have millions and many ballots sent everywhere the place, sent to folks that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent to everyone. this is often a significant situation, this isn’t games, and you've got to urge it right," said the president.

Virginia recently sent half a million incorrect ballot applications to residents across the state, including individuals who have died.

In the past few weeks, Democratic leaders in Washington have pivoted the narrative to accuse the president of attempting to "manipulate the mail to deny eligible voters access to the ballot in pursuit of his re-election," consistent with a press release from Speaker Pelosi, legislator Schumer, and several other high-ranking Dems.

The official, Louis DeJoy, has agreed to suspend any changes being applied to US mail until after the election. He also will testify before a House oversight committee next week.
