Yes, you'll scream: David Arquette is officially returning as Sheriff Dewey Riley for the fifth installment of the ‘Scream’ slasher film series\! David even shared a press release.

The sheriff’s back in town\! David Arquette, 48, will reprise the role of Sheriff Dewey Riley for Scream 5. David sounds beyond excited to bully-off against Ghostface (or whoever is going to be behind the mask) once more.

David has starred altogether four of the Scream films (1996, 1997, 2000, and 2011), but it's been nearly a decade since the last sequel. Not many other details are often teased, but Spyglass “says that talks are underway to bring back more legacy cast members,” consistent with Deadline. one among these cast members in fact includes Neve Campbell, who played the leading role of Sidney Prescott in every Scream installment.

“They’ve come to me and we’re having conversations,” Neve revealed to YouTube host Jake Hamilton in an interview shared on May 6. Of course, plans can’t exactly be solidified amid a pandemic.

> Neve added, “It’s a touch hard at the instant due to COVID to understand when that’ll happen and hopefully we will see eye to eye on all the weather that need to inherit place for it to happen.”

However, production is reportedly set to start later in 2020 in Wilmington, North Carolina once safety protocols are in placeSheriff Dewey Riley (David Arquette) with Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) in 2011’s Scream 4. The co-stars also enjoyed a romance off-screen and were married between 1999-2010 (the divorce wasn’t finalized until 2013). They share a 15-year-old daughter, Coco Arquette.

James Vanderbilt, who wrote Zodiac, The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2, and White House Down, is co-writing an ingenious story for Scream 5 with Guy Busick (Ready or Not, Castle Rock). Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (the same duo behind the horror film Ready or Not) will function directors.
