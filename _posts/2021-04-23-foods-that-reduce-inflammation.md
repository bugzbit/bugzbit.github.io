Inflammation is triggered in the White Blood Cells, when a foreign body-such as a microbe, chemicals or pollen attacks our body. This is a self defense mechanism in the body; that protects our health from threatening invaders.

However, when inflammation persists for a continued period, even when you are not threatened by foreign invader, then it becomes our enemy in disguise. Diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis are a consequence of chronic inflammation.

One can fight inflammation with a well informed healthy balanced diet. An anti-inflammatory food routine is predominantly high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and healthy oils. That's a wholesome Mediterranean Meal; precisely what you need to reduce levels of inflammation.

Tomatoes, olives, a lot of greens, nuts like almonds, walnuts, fatty fish like Salmon, fruits like strawberries, cherry, oranges and blackberries make a great addition to your Anti- Inflammatory diet.

In addition to this, a more natural, less processed diet can have a visible effect on your physical and emotional health. Thereby, uplifting your mood and improving overall quality of life.

And rightly so, choose the right diet to reduce your risk of illness.

Say No to junk and processed food. And yes, to natural food to stay healthy..\!\!
